			<p>I was born in 1998 in India. Since then, I have lived in France for 2 years, and Kosovo for 3.5 years, before I moved to New York City in 2009. I have attended a total of 10 schools in my life. Currently, I am a senior at the <a href="http://www.unis.org/"> United Nations International School (UNIS)</a>. </p>

			<p>I found my love for programming and CS in my sophomore year through a "Game Design in Java" class. I spent my afternoons building games in Processing at home, awed by the fact that I can build anything on my laptop. By the end of the year, I had built 5 games, none of which were part of a class assignment or project. Since then, I learned as much as I could. I learned web development, 3D game development in Unity3D, and mobile app development (both Android and iOS) mostly through YouTube videos. I also spent time solving programming challenges on websites such as <a href="http://coderbyte.com/">coderbyte</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a>.</p>

			<p>To share my passion for programming with others, I created a club in my school called "UNIS Codes". We learn by making projects and helping each other out. Making things is the best way to learn. Experienced members become mentors and help new members. Not only is this method effective to teach new members, but it also solidifies learning for more experienced members. In addition, to help others learn programming, I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsZmuEEHcbU&list=PLf5zPS-STiK8JoDStTZFnYsjoJ61Ssa4I&index=1"> YouTube tutorial series</a> that goes over how to create a pong game. All the videos in that playlist combined now have over 15000 views, which means they have not only helped members of the club, but thousands of others around the World.<p>

			<p>This summer, I attended an AI summer course at Stanford University, where I met some truly awesome friends there. In fact, I even worked with a friend to build a 3D self driving car using artificial neural networks. Our biggest difficulty was choosing the right features -- quantifying the present state of the car and the environment.<p>

			<p>After returning home, I watched <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/">Andrew Ng's Machine Learning</a> course. Machine learning algorithms are practically just elegant mathematical equations. Seeing these videos and the power of machine learning has opened a whole new field of fascination for me. Since then, I have worked on the projects listed in "Projects". Technology, particularly machine learning, is a field actively changing the world, and I want to harness its full potential to create a better world.</p>
