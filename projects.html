					<h2>FootConnect</h2>
					<p>I am currently working on building the ultimate platform for buying and selling shoes with my friend Matthew. This will be initially be an app for iOS, but we will soon move to other platforms. This is not for a hackathon; this is a full summer project before university. I am the full stack developer, building the front-end with XCode and Swift, and the back-end with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.</p>

					<h2>Self Driving Car</h2>
					<p>Rohan and I developed a python artificial neural network to drive a virtual car and environment made in Unity3D. The car is capable of turning, braking, and accelerating. To train the neural network, the user drives the car (correctly), and then the neural network uses backpropogation to learn from the user. After driving the car multiple times on various tracks, the AI learns to drive on its own. This video shows the AI driving on its own.</p>

					<h2>Wrist Caffeine</h2>
					<p>Every year in the United States, thousands of people are injured due to drowsy driving, breaking the hearts of many families. In HackRPI 2015, my friend and I built a smart-watch app called "Wrist Caffeine" that detects if a person is falling asleep and vibrates to wake them up. It can help reduce drowsy driving, and even help students stay awake in class! </p>

					<h2>BookTrade</h2>
					<p>In PennApps XII (2015), my team and I built an iOS app to enable students to buy and sell books to each other in a more central, simple, and structured system. Books, particularly textbooks, can be a financial burden for university students, so this app would allow them to sell textbooks they no longer need and buy textbooks for cheaper prices This was my first iOS app ever, and I plan on continuing this project when I start university</p>

					<h2>Life of Ball Infinite</h2>
					<p>Over the summer of 2015, I built this game for mobile devices using Unity3D. In this game, you are a 3D ball that you can control by tilting or through a touch screen joystick. You must think fast to stay alive for as long as possible in a world where platforms are continuously being created and destroyed. Red platforms self destruct immediately, whereas green platforms give some time.</p>
