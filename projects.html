					<h2>Self Driving Car</h2>
					<p>As part of our final project at Stanford University's Precollegiate Summer Institute Artificial Intelligence course, Rohan and I developed a python artificial neural network to drive a virtual car and environment made in Unity3D. The car is capable of turning, braking, and accelerating.</p>

					<h2>Wrist Caffeine</h2>
					<p>In HackRPI 2015, my friend and I built a smart-watch app called "Wrist Caffeine" that detects if a person is falling asleep and vibrates to wake them up. It can help reduce drowsy driving, and help students stay awake in class! </p>

					<h2>BookTrade</h2>
					<p>In PennApps XII (2015), my team and I built an iOS app to enable students to buy and sell books to each other in a more central, simple, and structured system than social media. Books, particularly textbooks, can be a financial burden for university students, so this app would allow them to trade textbooks no longer need with other students at lower prices. Buyers and sellers use to app to list and buy books, and after paying, they meet to hand the book to each other.</p>

					<h2>Life of Ball Infinite</h2>
					<p>Over the summer of 2015, I built this game for mobile devices using Unity3D. In this game, you are a 3D ball that you can control by tilting or through a touch screen joystick. You must think fast to stay alive for as long as possible in a world where platforms are continuously being created and destroyed. Red platforms self destruct immediately, whereas green platforms give some time.</p>
