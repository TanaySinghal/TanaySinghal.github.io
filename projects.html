					<h2>Self Driving Car</h2>
					<p>As part of our final project at Stanford University's Precollegiate Summer Institute Artificial Intelligence course, Rohan and I developed a python artificial neural network to drive a virtual car and environment made in Unity3D. The car is capable of turning, braking, and accelerating.</p>

					<h2>BookTrade</h2>
					<p>In PennApps XII, my team and I built an app to replace Buying and Selling Book groups on social media with a more centralized, simple, and structured system that allows users to see the reliability of sellers through reviews. Books, particularly textbooks, can be a financial burden for university students. This app would reduce cost for students looking to buy or rent a textbook for a particular course. Sellers can list their books for sale on this app, so buyers can search it up. When a buyer purchases a book, the buyer and seller would meet each other face to face and sell books.</p>

					<h2>Life of Ball Infinite</h2>
					<p>Over the summer of 2015, I built this game for mobile devices using Unity3D. In this game, you are a 3D ball that you can control by tilting or through a touch screen joystick. You must think fast to stay alive for as long as possible in a world where platforms are continuously being created and destroyed. Red platforms self destruct immediately, whereas green platforms give some time.</p>
